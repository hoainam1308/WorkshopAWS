## Overview
***ℹ️ What You Need to Prepare***  
In this workshop, you will build a complete Amazon VPC environment following AWS best practices for networking architecture and security. You will create all the essential components required for deploying a production-ready VPC.

Additionally, it's recommended to host your source code on GitHub for easy access and deployment.
