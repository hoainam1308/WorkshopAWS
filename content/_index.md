# Starting Deploy Web to AWS

#### E-commerce Website Project  
The e-commerce website project is built with a Node.js backend, MongoDB database, and React frontend. The system supports core features such as user registration, login, adding products to the cart, payment, and viewing the order history. This serves as a scalable foundation for modern e-commerce applications.

#### AWS Services Used
- **Amazon EC2**: Deploy the Node.js backend.
- **Amazon S3**: Store and serve the static React frontend.
- **Amazon DocumentDB**: Provide a MongoDB-compatible database with scalability, backup, and encryption capabilities.
